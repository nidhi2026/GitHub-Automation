# GitHub-Automation
So much exciting to cre ate a new repository right from this code, using selenium and driving seamlessly and add more charm using tkinter and dont forget about BeautifulSoup! 

# Kick-Start
*Selenium* is a powerful python library for automation of web browser
You can install it using
`pip install selenium`
or if you are using anaconda
`conda install -c conda-forge selenium`.

Then you need to download a web-driver, in chrome it's ChromeDriver, in firefox it's geckodriver.

Here you will get the links to drivers https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ .

In my case I am using chromedriver (Remember the version of your chrome driver should match up with the version of chrome you are using)
and once can use any web browser like firfox, safari, edge, of your choice...
